2. ### Click a specific product to add it to the cart
3. ### View the number of items in my cart
  - The cart should display number of items added
  - The cart should display total price
  - A delivery fee for orders below 200sek should be applied
  - The store should have a never ending "Take 3 pay for 2 offer (cheapest product for free)
